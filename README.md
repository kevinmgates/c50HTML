### What is HTML?

- text, media, styles, assets that control the content and layout of a page
- Think of a word document
- It is fairly static unless you write javascript to change the HTML (and the browser will re-render it)
- Many types of semantic elements for specific types of content (header, text, images, video, bullets, line break, table, button)
- Several types of non-semantic elements for general use (div, span)
- Attributes to control the settings for each element (style, class, src, href)
- <write HTML in VS Code or ask someone to share their HTML>
    
### What is a browser?

- It is an HTML reader and translator
- It can read html from anywhere: from a static file on your local machine, a remote server, or dynamically
- It is the MOST universal of apps
- <view source of dreaddontdie, prologue in a browser>

### What is client-side code vs. server-side code?

- Browser is called the “client”
- Server side processing is typically used to do database look ups or show specific information to one user vs another or to collect/save information the user entered in a form
- You process the information, generate HTML and send to the browser to render
- There is a lot that you can do with javascript these days so the lines between server and client side processing are blurred
- Where does C# and .NET run? Client or Server?
- Server side code needs a code-specific engine running to process the code (which may generate HTML back to the client)

### What is Javascript?

- Javascript ≠ Java!!!
- A programming language that let’s you add LOGIC to your website
    - when this is clicked, do this
    - After xx seconds, do this
    - when you move your mouse here, show this
    - Loop through a list, for each one, do this
- You can create, change or remove elements or attributes ANYWHERE in the webpage (you refer to the ID of the element)
- Can run client side or server side
